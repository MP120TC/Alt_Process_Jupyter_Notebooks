    "# Refine an Existing LUT (.cube) Using a Second LUT (.cube) and Output a Smoothed New LUT file\n",
    "This notebook allows you to refine an existing LUT curve from a .cube file using a second .cube file.  The workflow would normally be:\n",
    "1. Run testing procedures and obtain the first LUT .cube file\n",
    "1. Apply the first LUT .cube file to the same test image (step wedge) to make a new negative and print it\n",
    "1. Obtain the second LUT .cube file from the second print\n",
    "1. Refine/correct the first LUT .cube using the second LUT .cube file in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: It is assumed that all LUT .cube files are obtained from Easy Digital Negatives or that the .cube files were generated by the EDN_CSV_To_Smooth_Cube_File notebook (which uses Easy Digital Negatives CSV files).\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT\n",
    "**Both .cube files must contain the same number of entries.  If one file has 256 entries then both files must have 256 entries.  You cannot use a 21-step .cube file in conjunction with a 256-step .cube file. If you try this, you will encounter errors.**\n",
    "### Output .cube File\n",
    "The output of this notebook is a new .cube file that contains the smoothed, refined LUT curve.  You could further refine that .cube by using it as the first LUT .cube file and run through these procedures again.  At some point you'll just be chasing perfection that cannot be attained, so it is uncommon to run through more than two iterations.  One refinement iteration may even be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output .cube file will use the name you provide (when prompted) and will be saved in the same folder as the first .cube file.\n",
    "### How To Use This Notebook\n",
    "The code in this notebook is organized into cells.  Each cell can be run independently, providing all prerequisite imports have been done and all variables exist.  However, **it is recommended that you run all code cells in sequence.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The exceptions to this normal operation are that you may wish to run the [Refine the First Curve Using the Second Curve](#Refine-the-First-Curve-Using-the-Second-Curve) or [Smooth the New Curve and Plot the Results](#Smooth-the-New-Curve-and-Plot-the-Results) cells more than once, providing different refinement or smoothing values until you are satisfied with the results.  Once you are happy with the resulting curve, you can then move on to the [Save the New Curve to a .cube File](#Save-the-New-Curve-to-a-.cube-File) cell to save the new .cube file."
